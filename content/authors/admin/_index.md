I am a Senior Researcher at the [Space Research Laboratory ](https://srl.utu.fi) at the University of Turku in Finland. As a member of multiple EU Horizon Europe projects that investigate Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events, I am focussing on the analysis of energetic charged particles in the helisophere, with an emphasis on providing open-source Python software for this purpose. Furthermore, within the *Finnish Centre of Ex­cel­lence in Research of Sustainable Space* ([FORESAIL](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/finnish-centre-of-excellence-in-research-of-sustainable-space)), I am investigating charged particles measured in the vicinity of Earth using CubeSats.
