abstract: 'On their way through the heliosphere, galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are modulated
  by various effects before they can be detected at Earth. This process can be described
  by the Parker equation, which calculates the phase space distribution of GCRs depending
  on the main modulation processes: convection, drifts, diffusion, and adiabatic energy
  changes. A first-order approximation of this equation is the force field approach,
  reducing it to a one-parameter dependency, the solar modulation potential ϕ. Utilizing
  this approach, it is possible to reconstruct ϕ from ground-based and spacecraft
  measurements. However, it has been shown previously that ϕ depends not only on the
  local interstellar spectrum (LIS) but also on the energy range of interest. We have
  investigated this energy dependence further, using published proton intensity spectra
  obtained by PAMELA and heavier nuclei measurements from IMP-8 and ACE/CRIS. Our
  results show severe limitations at lower energies including a strong dependence
  on the solar magnetic epoch. Based on these findings, we will outline a new tool
  to describe GCR proton spectra in the energy range from a few hundred MeV to tens
  of GeV over the last solar cycles. In order to show the importance of our modification,
  we calculate the global production rates of the cosmogenic radionuclide 10 Be which
  is a proxy for the solar activity ranging back thousands of years.'
