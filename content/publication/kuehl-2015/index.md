abstract: The solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) can be studied in detail
  by long term vari-ations of the GCR energy spectrum (e.g.  on the scales of a solar
  cycle).  With almost 20 yearsof data, the Electron Proton Helium INstrument (EPHIN)
  aboard SOHO is well suited for thesekind of investigations. Although the design
  of the instrument is optimized to measure proton andhelium isotope spectra up to
  50 MeV/nucleon the capability exists that allow to determine energyspectra up to
  above 300 MeV/nucleon. Therefore we developed a sophisticated inversion methodto
  calculate such proton spectra.  The method relies on a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation
  ofthe instrument and a simplified spacecraft model that calculates the energy response
  function ofEPHIN for electrons, protons and heavier ions. In order to determine
  the energy spectra the result-ing inversion problem is solved numerically.  As a
  result we present galactic cosmic ray spectrafrom 2006-2009.  For validation, the
  derived spectra are compared to those determined by thePAMELA instrument.
