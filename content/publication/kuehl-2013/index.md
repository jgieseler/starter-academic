abstract: 'The transport environment for particles in the heliosphere, e.g. galactic
  cosmic rays (GCRs) and MeV electrons (including those originating from Jupiters
  magnetosphere), is defined by the solar wind flow and the structure of the embedded
  heliospheric magnetic field. Solar wind structures, such as co-rotating interaction
  regions (CIR), can result in periodically modulation of both particles species.
  A detailed analysis of this recurrent Jovian electron events and galactic cosmic
  ray decreases measured by SOHO EPHIN is presented here, showing clearly a change
  of phase between both phenomena during the cause of the years 2007 and 2008. This
  effect can be explained by the change of difference in heliolongitude between the
  Earth and Jupiter, which is of central importance for the propagation of Jovian
  electrons. Furthermore, the data can be ordered such that the 27-day Jovian electron
  variation vanishes in the sector which does not connect the Earth with Jupiter magnetically
  using observed solar wind speeds. '
