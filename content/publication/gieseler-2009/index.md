abstract: "It is well known that the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux is modulated by
  corotating interaction regions (CIR) in the vicinity of Earth. When Ulysses first
  explored high latitude regions in 1996, it was found that the flux of GCRs was still
  modulated on the time scale of one solar rotation, although neither the solar wind
  nor the interplanetary magnetic field at these latitudes showed the characteristics
  of CIRs. This finding led to the modification of our understanding of either the
  heliospheric magnetic field (HMF, Fisk field) or the transport of particles perpendicular
  to the HMF. Now, 12 years later, Ulysses explored these high latitude regions again.
  From September 2007 to September 2008, the GCR flux at Earth showed a clear 27 day
  solar-rotation modulation. In this contribution, we show that the intensities of
  GCRs and Jovian electrons at the location of Earth are well modulated with the expected
  time periods of 27 and 26 days, respectively."
