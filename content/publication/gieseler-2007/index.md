abstract: The radial gradient of galactic cosmic rays in the inner heliosphere is
  studied, using the 125 to~ 200 MeV/n Helium channel from the Kiel Electron Telescope
  aboard Ulysses and the 147-198 MeV/n carbon channel from the Cosmic Ray Isotope
  Spectrometer aboard ACE. The time period from 1997 to 2006 covers the solar minima
  in the A> 0-solar magnetic epoch, the solar magnetic reversal to an A< 0-magnetic
  epoch at solar maximum and the declining phase of solar cycle 23. We determined
  the radial gradient between Ulysses and Earth by assuming that the radial gradient
  is the same during 1998 and 2004, when Ulysses was at a radial distance of about
  5 AU. The analyses for the time period from 1997 to 2006, when the spacecraft was
  below 30 S, resulted in a radial gradient of Gr= 4.5Â±0.6%/AU, which is consistent
  with previous measurements.
