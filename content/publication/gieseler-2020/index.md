abstract: The Radiation Monitor (RADMON) on-board Aalto-1 CubeSat is an energetic
  particle detector that fulfills the requirements of small size, low power consumption
  and low budget. Aalto-1 was launched on 23 June 2017 to a sun-synchronous polar
  orbit with 97.4° inclination and an average altitude of somewhat above 500 km. RADMON
  has been measuring integral particle intensities from October 2017 to May 2018 with
  electron energies starting at low-MeV and protons from 10 MeV upwards. In this paper,
  we present first electron and proton intensity maps obtained over the mission period.
  In addition, the response of RADMON measurements to magnetospheric dynamics are
  analyzed, and the electron observations are compared with corresponding measurements
  by the PROBA-V/EPT mission. Finally, we describe the RADMON data set, which is made
  publicly available.
