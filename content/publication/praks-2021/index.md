abstract: 'The design, integration, testing and launch of the first Finnish satellite
  Aalto-1 is briefly presented in this paper. Aalto-1, a three-unit CubeSat, launched
  into Sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of approximately 500 km, is operational
  since June 2017. It carries three experimental payloads: Aalto Spectral Imager(AaSI),
  Radiation Monitor (RADMON) and Electrostatic Plasma Brake (EPB). AaSI is a hyperspectral
  imager in visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength bands, RADMON is an energetic
  particle detector and EPB is a de-orbiting technology demonstration payload. The
  platform was designed to accommodate multiple payloads while ensuring sufficient
  data, power, radio, mechanical and electrical interfaces. The design strategy of
  platform and payload subsystems consists of in-house development and commercial
  subsystems. The CubeSat Assembly, Integration & Test (AIT) followed Flatsat-Engineering-Qualication
  Model (EQM)-Flight Model (FM) model philosophy for qualification and acceptance.
  The paper briefly describes the design approach of platform and payload subsystems,
  their integration and test campaigns and spacecraft launch. The paper also describes
  the ground segment & services that were developed by Aalto-1 team.'
