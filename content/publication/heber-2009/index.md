abstract: During the latest Ulysses out-of-ecliptic orbit the solar wind density,
  pressure, and magnetic field strength have been the lowest ever observed in the
  history of space exploration. Since cosmic ray particles respond to the heliospheric
  magnetic field in the expanding solar wind and its turbulence, the weak heliospheric
  magnetic field as well as the low plasma density and pressure are expected to cause
  the smallest modulation since the 1970s. In contrast to this expectation, the galactic
  cosmic ray (GCR) proton flux at 2.5 GV measured by Ulysses in 2008 does not exceed
  the one observed in the 1990s significantly, while the 2.5 GV GCR electron intensity
  exceeds the one measured during the 1990s by 30%–40%. At true solar minimum conditions,
  however, the intensities of both electrons and protons are expected to be the same.
  In contrast to the 1987 solar minimum, the tilt angle of the solar magnetic field
  has remained at about 30° in 2008. In order to compare the Ulysses measurements
  during the 2000 solar magnetic epoch with those obtained 20 years ago, the former
  have been corrected for the spacecraft trajectory using latitudinal gradients of
  0.25% deg−1 and 0.19% deg−1 for protons and electrons, respectively, and a radial
  gradient of 3% AU−1. In 2008 and 1987, solar activity, as indicated by the sunspot
  number, was low. Thus, our observations confirm the prediction of modulation models
  that current sheet and gradient drifts prevent the GCR flux to rise to typical solar
  minimum values. In addition, measurements of electrons and protons allow us to predict
  that the 2.5 GV GCR proton intensity will increase by a factor of 1.3 if the tilt
  angle reaches values below 10°.
