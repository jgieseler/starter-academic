abstract: RADMON is a small radiation monitor designed and assembled by students of
  University of Turku and University of Helsinki. It is flown on-board Aalto-1, a
  3-unit CubeSat in low Earth orbit at about 500 km altitude. The detector unit of
  the instrument consists of two detectors, a Si solid-state detector and a CsI(Tl)
  scintillator, and utilizes the ΔE-E technique to determine the total energy and
  species of each particle hitting the detector. We present the results of the on-ground
  and in-flight calibration campaigns of the instrument, as well as the characterization
  of its response through extensive simulations within the Geant4 framework. The overall
  energy calibration margin achieved is about 5%. The full instrument response to
  protons and electrons is presented and the issue of proton contamination of the
  electron channels is quantified and discussed.
